# torsync
TorSync was written in order to have encrypted backups of my tor browser.
One of the first programs that I have written. It has room for many improvements.
It keeps track of tor browser backups by encrypting them.

## Backups Management
It connects to a MySQL database and enters in the date and time of creation into the database

## Google backups
It uploads the encrypted backup to your Google Drive.
